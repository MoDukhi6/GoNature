# Park Management System

## Overview
This Java application provides a comprehensive solution for managing a park, enabling visitors to reserve their spots, handling waiting lists when the park reaches capacity, and facilitating park workers, park managers, and department managers in their respective roles. It utilizes JavaFX for intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) created in SceneBuilder, and is developed using JDK 17.

## Features
- **Visitor Reservations**: Visitors can reserve spots in the park, with waiting lists implemented for full capacity situations.
- **Park Worker Functionality**: Park workers can enter and exit visitors, as well as generate PDF receipts for orders.
- **Park Manager Control**: Park managers have the ability to manage park capacity, set maximum stay times, and create detailed reports.
- **Department Manager Insights**: Department managers can also generate reports and visualize data through charts for better decision-making.
- **Visitor Services**: Special services allow normal visitors to be upgraded to guides, enabling them to reserve spots for additional people.
- **Email Integration**: Email notifications are sent to visitors for reservation approvals or cancellations, with responses automatically handled by the system. Additionally, visitors are notified via email when they are removed from the waiting list.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaFX**: Utilized for creating rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in conjunction with SceneBuilder.
- **JDK 17**: Developed using the latest Java Development Kit for optimal performance and compatibility.
